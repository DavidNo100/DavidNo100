### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

My name is David No and I am currently a Master's student at the Applied Data Science at Syracuse University.

I am also a microbiologist at the Washington State Department of Health Public Laboratories.

I am currently enrolled in the Machine Learning course and would like to apply what I've learned to my workplace.
